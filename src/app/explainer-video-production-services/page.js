      question: 'What is an explainer video?',
      answer: "An explainer video is a short, engaging video designed to convey complex ideas in a simple and understandable way. These videos often use animations, motion graphics, or live-action to illustrate a product, service, or concept, making them effective tools for marketing, education, and internal communications.â€‹"
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does an explainer video cost?',
      answer: "The cost of an explainer video varies depending on factors such as complexity, style, and duration. For instance, a 60-second whiteboard animation might range from $2,300 to $3,000, while a 2D animated video could cost between $3,000 and $4,500. More intricate 3D animations may range from $6,000 to $9,000 for the same length.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the typical production timeline for an explainer video?',
      answer: "The production timeline for an explainer video can vary based on its complexity and length. On average, it takes about 4 to 6 weeks to complete a standard explainer video, encompassing stages like scriptwriting, storyboarding, animation, and revisions. However, timelines can be adjusted to meet specific project needs.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I provide input during the production process?',

Reputable production companies encourage client involvement during key stages such as script development, storyboarding, and animation to ensure the final product aligns with your vision and objectives. â€‹",
    },
    {
      question: 'Are revisions included in the production process?',
      answer: "Yes, most explainer video production services include a set number of revisions at various stages of production, such as scriptwriting, storyboarding, and animation. This ensures the final video meets your expectations. It's advisable to discuss the revision policy with your chosen production company to understand the scope and any potential additional costs.â€‹",
